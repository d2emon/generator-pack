"""
Anz没 Name.

Anz没 are beings from Mesopotamian religions, sometimes represented as a lesser deity and sometimes
as a monster. They're likewise represented as either a gigantic, fire- and water-breathing bird or
as a lion-headed eagle not too dissimilar from griffins. They're generally tied to rain, with the
roar of a lion representing thunder and a large, dark storm-cloud in the shape of an eagle forming
their body. But in Anz没 depictions have changed over time as myths are prone to do.

As far as names go, I've used Mesopotamian names for this name generator. They won't be true names,
but altered ones to create a familiar, but different feel overall to mimic the otherworldly nature
of such a mythical being. Either way, there's plenty to pick from.
