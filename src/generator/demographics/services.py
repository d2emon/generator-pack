    In a village of 400 people, just how many inns and taverns are realistic? Not very many. Maybe not even one. When
traveling across the countryside, characters should not run into a convenient sign saying "Motel: Free Cable and
Swimming Pool" every 3 leagues. For the most part, they will have to camp on their own or seek shelter in people's
homes.

    Provided they are friendly, the latter option should be no trouble. A farmer can live in a single place all his
life, and he will welcome news and stories of adventures, not to mention any money the heroes might offer!

    Each type of business is given a Support Value (SV). This is the number of people it takes to support a single
business of that sort. For instance, the SV for spice merchants is 1,400. This means that there will be one spice
merchant for every 1,400 people in an area. This can vary by up to 60% in either direction, but provide a useful
baseline for GMs (the top spots are even more variable as they'll depend on the industries the town specializes in;
medieval Paris, the model for this list and a fantastic model for any fantasy city, was a shoemaking center). Think
about the nature of the town or city to decide which numbers to change. A port, for instance, will have more
fishmongers.

    To find the number of, say, inns in a city, divide the population of the city by the SV value for inns (2,000).
For a village of 400 people, this reveals only 20% of an inn! This means that there is a 20% chance of there being one
at all. And even if there is one, it will be smaller and less impressive than an urban inn. The SV for taverns is 400,
so there will be a single tavern.

    Some other figures: There will be one noble household per 200 population, one lawyer ("advocate") per 650, one
clergyman per 40 and one priest per 25-30 clergy.

    Businesses not listed here will most likely have an SV from 5,000 to 25,000! The "Magic Shop" means a shop where
wizards can purchase spell ingredients, scroll paper and the like, not a place to buy magic swords off the shelf.
