"""
    Fantasy worlds come in many varieties, from the "hard core" medieval-simulation school to the more fanciful realms
of high fantasy, with alabaster castles and jeweled gardens in the place of the more traditional muddy squalor. Despite
their differences, these share a vital common element: ordinary people. Most realms of fantasy, no matter how baroque
or magical, can not get by without a supply of ordinary farmers, merchants, quarreling princes and palace guards.
Clustered into villages and crowding the cities, they provide the human backdrop for adventure. Of course, doing the
research necessary to find out how common a large city should be, or how many shoemakers can be found in a town, can
take up time not all GMs have available. To the end of more satisfying world design, I've prepared this article.

    This article is a distillation of broad possibilities drawn from a variety of historical reference points, focusing
more on results than on the details that create them. The rules here provide a baseline to be deviated from at need,
not numbers cast into iron. Following my favorite FRP traditions, I've focused my lens on a fairly developed version
of the middle ages - I've drawn freely from periods ranging from the 11th to 15th centuries, and from locales as varied
as Russia, England, France, Germany and Italy, but when I've needed a default rather than an average, I opted to look
more closely at late-medieval France as a good model for a trad-fantasy gameworld. Halve things, double things, or
otherwise fiddle with them to suit the feel you're going for; I've included guidelines on shaping the numbers to suit
your needs.

* Town and City Population: How Many In Those Walls?
* Population Spread
* An Example Kingdom: Chamlek
* Merchants and Services
* Agriculture

# Bibliography

    The SV list was taken (mostly) from the tax list of Paris in 1292, and checked against other sources. This list can
be found in Life in a Medieval City by Joseph and Francis Geis (Harper and Row, 1981). This is a fine book by amateur
historians, which includes some fascinating descriptions of medieval city life and layout. You can also find the list
(including less-truncated versions) online if you poke around. Other books consulted include:

* Medieval Cities, by Henri Pirenne. Doubleday.
* The Castle Story, by Sheila Sancha. Harper Colophon.
* The Medieval Town, by John H. Mundy and Peter Riesenberg. Robert E. Krieger Publishing Company.
* The Medieval Town, by Fritz RÃ¶rig. University of California Press.
* Medieval Regions and Their Cities, by Josiah Cox Russel. David & Charles press.
