    City Size: Cities and towns of the Middle Ages cover about one square mile of land per 38,850 people, on average.
This is a density of about 61 per acre or 150 per hectare, so the land within the walls of a typical city of 10,000
would be 165 acres - hardly a city by modern standards, in terms of population OR size. Some extraordinarily-dense
supercities may have had densities up to 4x this high (but note that historians proposing those densities also propose
higher populations for the cities themselves; it's an area where scholars disagree), and some sparse cities almost
certainly had densities less than 100/ha. In general, the 150/ha average is a great place to focus, and let exceptions
occur as needed.

    Law Enforcement: A well-kept medieval city will have 1 law officer (guardsman, watchman, etc.) for every 150
citizens. Slack cities will have half this number. A few rare cities will have more.

    Institutions of Higher Learning: There will be one University for every 27.3 million people. This should be
computed by continent, not by town! This figure assumes entirely scholarly universities, not those dedicated to the
arcane arts. Whether or not magical universities are separate institutions, and how common they are, is a matter for GM
decision.

    Livestock: The livestock population, on the whole, will equal 2.2 times the human population, but 68% percent of
this will be fowl (chickens, geese and ducks). The rest will be dairy cows and "meat animals:" Pigs are superior as
food animals, since they eat less individually, and are not picky eaters. Sheep will be extremely common if the region
has a wool market (like medieval England, which was built on wool). Cattle for labor and milk will be found
occasionally, but cattle raised specifically for meat are only found in very prosperous areas.
