    Okay, we now completely understand the lay of the land as regards civilization, the cities and farms. Nearer to the
heart of the adventurer, however, is the castle, or better still, the ruined castle. Once again, how many should there
be?

    Ruins, first of all, depend on the age of the region. The following formula is only a guide. The frequency of ruins
in Europe varied greatly depending on military history and remoteness of the area. To determine the approximate number
of ruined fortifications, divide the kingdom's population by five million. Multiply the result by the square root of
the kingdom's age. If the kingdom has changed hands a lot, use the total age-the number of years that castle-building
people have lived there, regardless of the Royal Lineage.

    Chamlek, our island kingdom, has around 6.6 million people today. Chamlek has been populated by castle-building
folk for 300 years. She has 23.04 ruined forts or castles, which means 23 for sure, and a 4% chance of one more.

    Active castles are much more common; ruins are rare because the solid ones are constantly put back into service!
Assume one functioning castle for every 50,000 people. The age of the kingdom is not really a factor. Chamlek would
have 133 active castles of various stripes, approximately.

    75% of all castles will be in the civilized (settled) areas of a kingdom. The other 25% will be in the
"wilderness," along borders, etc.

    The role of these castles is something too world-oriented to be reduced to formula. Most will mark the landholdings
of Barons and Dukes, but some may be bandit strongholds, or the outposts of Goblin warlords. It is all up to the GM.
