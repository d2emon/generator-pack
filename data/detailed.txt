$name : My Big Overly Detailed Character Generator

$description : This is my personal go-to character generator that randomly generates physical descriptions and traits for human characters.  If you’ve stumbled upon this, you’ll probably not understand what some of the traits mean unless you’ve done as extensive note-taking as I have, and even then it might still be confusing, but if you can understand it, then go right ahead and use this as much as you would like.  This is just to get me started, and I can change whatever doesn't make sense.
